# What is User Interface/ User Experience Design (UI/UX) ?

Increasingly, with the development of technology, more and more people are getting involved in design. For beginners, it’s important to know the difference between UI and UX design. Having a comprehensive theoretical understanding about design is the first and necessary step in becoming a UI/UX designer, **so lets get started** :muscle:
## What is User Interface Design ? 

The user interface is the **visual appearance** of a product, and UI designers decide how to visually design the product for effective user experience. A good UI design helps attract users and ensures a pleasant product experience. UI design is made up features such as texts, buttons, images, text fields, checkboxes and behaviours that will happen when the users carry out any action on the interface.

### User Interface is
* How people interact with a product
* The visual aspect of a product
* A bridge between a human and a system


## What is User Experience Design ? 

User experience design is the process of researching, developing, and improving all aspects of user interaction with a company ’s product to satisfy its users. The goal is to **improve the user’s experience** with the product through test results, ultimately creating a product that is useful and valuable, as well as easy to obtain, pleasing to use.

UX design contributes to a product that provides an effective user experience. It includes different disciplines, such as visual design, interaction design, usability, and more.

### User Experience is
* What a user feels when using a product pr service
* Imoortant role and factor in all forms of marketing
* Very important in designing web and mobile apps
* Serves as a bridge between a product and its target audience

## Differences between UI and UX 
UI design and UX design always overlap, but are you really clear about their differences? Simply, UX design refers to user experience design, and UI design refers to the user interface design. They have a close relationship in product design but serve different roles as they complement each other :

|UI       |UX        |
|----------|----------|
| How things look    | How things work   |
| A deliverable   | A process |
| Make emotional connections   | Helps users accomplish goals   |
